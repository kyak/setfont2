This is a 6x10 console font.
It allows for 53x24 terminal size on Ben Nanonote.
This a fork of 6x11 regular (i.e. colored) kernel font.

This font doesn't use setfont2 (i.e. SubLCD technique),
so it looks worse than setfont2 font.
From the other hand side, it provides colors,
which might be important in some applications.

This font and conversion tools (png2font and font2png)
are in setfont2 repo because they fit with setfont2's purpose:
Provide better looking console fonts for Ben Nanonote.
